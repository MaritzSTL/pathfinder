[WIP: this is simply an outline of a post to be fleshed out. getting this set up for deploy purposes]

### The ask:
* This blog as a centralized, open place to facilitate innovation process
* 2 surveys, administered monthly
* Dev round table

### The mechanism:
* Source: https://ideas.riverglide.com/3x-explore-expand-extract-b9aad6402a5a
* Ideas flow through three potential phases - explore, expand, extract.
* **Explore** - the risky search for a viable return on a viable investment [via experimentation]…If you’re lucky, one of these experiments turns out to be unexpectedly successful, which leads to:
* **Expand** – now things are going nuts… Unanticipated bottlenecks appear… Once growth becomes routine, it’s time to:
* **Extract** - now the shape of the problem and solution spaces are clear. One euro in equals three euros out. Playbooks emerge…Economies of scale matter…”

Explore costs nothing. Contribute whenever feel like it.

Expand must turn into exploratory tickets, either spike or implementation.

Extract is when it becomes a full-fledged thing, made available in a first class way to everyone inside product engineering.

Each phase comes with a corresponding PR template.

### Existing efforts:
* GraphQL
* Graph DB
* Monorepo
* more but etc

### How do we tell if this is working?

* Monitor analytics on this blog
* Administer two monthly surveys. This should cause positive change in these scores:
  * NPS
  * Culture Survey
* Individual Efforts

### Outstanding Questions
* What's expand phase look like? How do people get space to act?
